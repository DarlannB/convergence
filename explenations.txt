The purpose of this program is to simulate two planes with their trajectory and to determine if the vectors are convergents or divergents.
This is a test program wich have for objective to determine if the mathematical equations and the convergency vector supervision is helpfull for flight automatic labelisation.

Mechanical referential is Spherical.
We make the hypothesis that de Earth is perfectly spherical.

DO_AB=r*arcos(cos(thetaA)*cos(thetaB)+sin(thetaA)*sin(thetaB)*cos(phiB-phiA))
r=HearthRadius + Z  #Where Z is altitude

Steps of development:

I- Modelization of Aircraft as Objects.
II- Establishment of mathematical relation calculation
  i- Projection of displacement in the Referential
  ii- Transformation of the displacement from Spherical to Cartesian and return to Spherical
  iii- Oblical Distance calculatin
  iv- Dynamic of vectors analysis
III- GUI devlopment
  i- Localization show
  ii- Run calculation and vectorial analysis of aircrafts behaviours
  iii- Development of possibility to change aircraft attribut while running
  iv- Real Time Run
