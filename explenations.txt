The purpose of this program is to simulate two planes with their trajectory and to determine if the vectors are convergents or divergents.
This is a test program wich have for objective to determine if the mathematical equations and the convergency vector supervision is helpfull for flight automatic labelisation.

Mechanical referential is Spherical.
We make the hypothesis than de Earth is perfectly spherical.

DO_AB=r*arcos(cos(thetaA)*cos(thetaB)+sin(thetaA)*sin(thetaB)*cos(phiB-phiA))
r=HearthRadius + Z  #Where Z is altitude
